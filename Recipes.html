        <p>I once ate strawberry Napoleon in a cafe in San Diego, and the taste made me unforgettable, so I found a recipe online to teach myself.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Salted Butter</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
            <li>Powder Sugar</li>
            <li>Puff Pastry Sheets</li>
            <li>Chopped Fresh Strawberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Add the egg yolks to a medium-sized bowl and gently beat them together. Set the bowl aside.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar, cornstarch and milk to a large saucepan and mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Cook the sugar mixture over medium-high heat, stirring continuously, until it begins to thicken and bubble.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and simmer the mixture for 2 minutes. Remove it from the heat.</li>
            <li>Add a small amount of the milk mixture to the egg yolks and whisk to combine, then add the egg mixture to milk mixture. This process ensures that you do not scramble the egg yolks.</li>
            <li>Place the pan back onto the heat and bring the mixture to a light boil. Allow it to boil for 2 minutes, stirring continuously.</li> 
            <li>Remove the mixture from the heat and add in the butter and vanilla extract. Stir until the batter is smooth, then cover it with clear wrap that touches the top of the cream (this helps prevent a film from forming on top). Refrigerate the batter until it is cool and you are ready to use it.</li>
            <li>Remove the two sheets of puff pastry from the box and cut each set into 3 strips, creating 6 strips total.</li>
            <li>Place the pastry strips onto a baking sheet and bake them for about 13 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pipe swirls of the whipped cream on top of the napoleons and top them off with some additional chopped strawberries.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the napoleons until you are ready to cut and serve them.</li>
        </ol>

                <li>First rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Add a small amount of the milk mixture to the egg yolks and whisk to combine, then add the egg mixture to milk mixture. This process ensures that you do not scramble the egg yolks.</li>
